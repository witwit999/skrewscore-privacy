Privacy Policy for SkrewScore
Last updated: 16-02-2026 
1. Introduction
SkrewScore (“we”, “our”, or “the app”) is a scorekeeping app for games and matches. This policy describes what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights. By using the app, you agree to this policy.
2. Data We Collect
Account data (if you create an account):
Email address, and optionally name or username (e.g. when you sign in with Apple, Google, or email). We use this only to create and manage your account and to sync your data.
Game data:
Data you enter in the app: matches (e.g. mode, number of rounds, winner), player names, team names, and scores. This is stored on your device and, if you are signed in, synced to our servers so you can use it across your devices.
Device / technical data:
We do not collect device identifiers, advertising IDs, or analytics for marketing. Our backend provider may process standard technical data (e.g. IP address, timestamps) to provide the service.
3. How We Use Your Data
To provide the app (scorekeeping, saving matches, optional cloud sync).
To create and manage your account when you sign in.
We do not sell your data. We do not use your data for advertising or profiling.
4. Who We Share Data With
Supabase: We use Supabase for authentication (sign-in) and to store your account and game data when you use sync. Supabase processes data according to their privacy policy and standard terms.
We do not share your data with other third parties for their marketing or advertising.
5. Where Your Data Is Stored
On your device (local storage).
If you use an account, also on Supabase’s infrastructure (we use HTTPS for all data in transit).
6. Your Rights and Choices
Access: You can see your data in the app (matches, players, scores).
Deletion: You can delete your account and associated data at any time from Settings in the app. This removes your profile and match data from our servers. Auth account data is handled according to our provider’s (Supabase) policies.
No account: You may use the app without an account; then data stays only on your device.
7. Data Retention
We keep your data for as long as your account exists. When you delete your account, we delete your profile and match-related data from our systems as described above.
8. Children
The app is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us data, contact us and we will delete it.
9. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy. We will post the updated version (e.g. in the app and/or on our website) and, where required by law, we will notify you of material changes.
